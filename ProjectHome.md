DMX (Digital MultipleX) is the present standard in lighting control, and this application aims to use it to trigger effects, such as sound playback, from the host PC. Interfacing with the DMX control would be performed through a hardware peripheral such as the Enttec OpenDMXUSB.

This application presently makes use of Qt Jambi to provide the graphical interface using Qt rather than Swing.
